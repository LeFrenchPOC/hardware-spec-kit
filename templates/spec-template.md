# Hardware Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: user needs, physical constraints, environmental requirements, interfaces
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear use case: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable and measurable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Hardware Components (if physical product involved)
7. Define Environmental & Regulatory Requirements
8. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
9. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for hardware planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY, and WHAT the hardware must do
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific MCU/SBC models, CAD tools, PCB layouts)
- üîß Written for product managers and systems engineers, not hardware designers
- üåç Consider real-world constraints (power, size, environment, regulations)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "wireless sensor" without protocol), mark it
3. **Think like a test engineer**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and measurable" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas for hardware**:
   - Operating environment (temperature, humidity, vibration, IP rating)
   - Power requirements and battery life expectations
   - Physical size, weight, and mounting constraints
   - Communication protocols and range requirements
   - User interface requirements (displays, buttons, indicators)
   - Regulatory and safety compliance needs
   - Manufacturing volume and cost targets
   - Maintenance and serviceability requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey and how they interact with the hardware product]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial conditions], **When** [user action], **Then** [expected hardware behavior]
2. **Given** [environmental condition], **When** [system operation], **Then** [expected performance]
3. **Given** [power condition], **When** [extended operation], **Then** [expected battery/power behavior]

### Edge Cases & Environmental Testing
- What happens when [environmental extreme - temperature, humidity, power loss]?
- How does system handle [physical stress - vibration, impact, moisture]?
- What are the failure modes when [component failure or communication loss]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific physical capability, e.g., "measure temperature within ¬±0.5¬∞C accuracy"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific interaction, e.g., "provide visual indication of operating status"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "configure system parameters via mobile app"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data/communication requirement, e.g., "transmit sensor data every 60 seconds"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [safety/protection requirement, e.g., "automatically shut down when overheating"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST communicate wirelessly via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: protocol not specified - WiFi, LoRa, Bluetooth, Zigbee?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST operate for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: battery life target not specified - hours, days, months?]

### Environmental & Operating Requirements *(include for physical products)*
- **Operating Temperature**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: range not specified, e.g., -20¬∞C to +60¬∞C]
- **Humidity Range**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: operating humidity not specified]
- **Power Requirements**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: voltage, current, battery type not specified]
- **Physical Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: size, weight, mounting requirements not specified]
- **Ingress Protection**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: IP rating for dust/water protection not specified]

### Hardware Components *(include if feature involves physical devices)*
- **[Component Type 1]**: [What it does, key specifications without specific part numbers]
- **[Component Type 2]**: [Function, interface requirements, performance targets]
- **[Communication Module]**: [Protocol requirements, range, power consumption targets]

### Regulatory & Compliance Requirements *(include if applicable)*
- **Safety Standards**: [Applicable safety certifications, e.g., UL, IEC]
- **Electromagnetic Compatibility**: [EMC requirements, e.g., FCC Part 15, CE]
- **Wireless Regulations**: [If applicable, e.g., frequency allocations, power limits]
