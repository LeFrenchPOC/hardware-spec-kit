# Hardware Spec Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Design-First Principle
Every hardware feature starts as a complete design specification with mechanical, electrical, and embedded components clearly defined. No implementation begins without:
- Mechanical design constraints and enclosure requirements
- Electrical schematic and power budgets
- Embedded firmware architecture and communication protocols
- Clear interfaces between subsystems

### II. Multi-Disciplinary Interface
Every hardware system exposes functionality through well-defined interfaces:
- Mechanical: Standard mounting points, connector placements, and assembly procedures
- Electrical: Documented pinouts, power requirements, and signal specifications  
- Embedded: API endpoints, communication protocols, and configuration interfaces
- Support both human-readable documentation and machine-readable formats (JSON, YAML)

### III. Test-First Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All hardware implementation MUST follow strict Design-for-Test principles:
1. Test procedures are defined during specification phase
2. Test procedures are validated and approved before implementation
3. Design validation tests are confirmed to exist before prototyping
- Mechanical: Stress testing, fit/clearance validation, material property verification
- Electrical: Design rule checks, signal integrity, power consumption validation
- Embedded: Unit tests, integration tests, real-world communication testing

### IV. Integration-First Validation
Hardware systems MUST be tested as integrated systems:
- Prefer real sensor/actuator interfaces over simulated inputs
- Use actual communication protocols and physical connections
- Environmental testing under realistic operating conditions
- Contract testing mandatory between mechanical/electrical/embedded interfaces

### V. Platform Modularity
Hardware designs MUST support modular implementation:
- Mechanical: Standardized mounting interfaces and enclosure systems
- Electrical: Modular PCB designs with standard connectors
- Embedded: Hardware abstraction layers and standardized communication
- Clear separation between platform-specific and application-specific components

## Hardware-Specific Constraints

### Design Tool Standards
- **Mechanical Design**: Fusion360 as primary CAD tool with standardized file organization
- **Electrical Design**: KiCAD for schematic capture and PCB layout with design rule compliance
- **Embedded Development**: Platform-specific IDEs (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, ESP-IDF) with version control
- **Documentation**: Consistent naming conventions and file structures across all tools

### Manufacturing Readiness
- All mechanical designs MUST include manufacturing constraints (tolerances, materials, processes)
- Electrical designs MUST pass design rule checks for chosen manufacturing process
- Bill of Materials (BOM) with sourcing information and cost targets
- Assembly procedures documented with tooling requirements

### Power and Environmental Constraints
- Power consumption budgets defined for all electrical subsystems
- Operating temperature and humidity ranges specified
- Ingress protection (IP) ratings defined for mechanical enclosures
- Regulatory compliance requirements (FCC, CE, safety standards) identified

## Development Workflow

### Design Phase Gates
Hardware development proceeds through mandatory phase gates:
1. **Specification Gate**: Requirements complete and validated
2. **Design Gate**: All subsystem designs complete and interfaces defined
3. **Validation Gate**: Design verification tests pass
4. **Implementation Gate**: Prototypes built and functional tests pass
5. **Manufacturing Gate**: Design for manufacturing review complete

### Version Control and Documentation
- All design files maintained in version control (Git LFS for binary files)
- Design changes tracked with rationale and impact analysis
- Manufacturing documentation automatically generated from design files
- Test procedures and results maintained alongside design files

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other hardware development practices. All design reviews and implementations must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity and deviations must be explicitly justified and documented.
